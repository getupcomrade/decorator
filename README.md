In this assignment, I used the Decorator pattern.
I have developed a system for buying computers and other devices. By purchasing a system unit, you can purchase additional input and output devices such as monitor, speakers, keyboard, etc. I have a PC interface implemented using the SystemUnit class and the abstract decorator class PCDecorator. The abstract class PCDecorator has been extended with additional classes: PCSpeakers, PCMonitor and PCKeyboard, Windows10key. When displayed, the console will show the price and devices that you have selected.
